## Introduction
The project is an e-commerce website that allows customers to browse and purchase products online. The goal of the project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website that provides customers with a seamless shopping experience.

## Requirements

## Architecture
The website will be built using a microservices architecture. The main components will be:

- Database: A MongoDB database that stores the products, customers, and orders data.
- Search: An Elasticsearch cluster that provides the search and filtering functionality.

## Design

- The frontend will use Redux for state management.
- The backend will use Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.

```js
// Example of the search feature code

router.get('/search', async (req, res) => {
try {
const query = req.query.q;
const products = await searchProducts(query);
res.json(products);
} catch (err) {
res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error searching products' });
}
});
```
