# TDD
Technical Design Documents

See [Writing a TDD](https://medium.com/machine-words/writing-technical-design-docs-71f446e42f2e) if you are unfamiliar with them.

## Do's and Dont's

- Do's:
  - Write down how you want to achieve your goal in detail. Doing so allows other engineers to contribute ideas you may not have thought of, but it also allows another engineer to pick up where you left off should you be unable to continue.
  - Divide your work into bite sized phases. Each phase will represent one PR, this helps track which changes broke and allows for smaller (and quicker!) code reviews.
  - Work with someone else if you'd like, you don't have to do this alone!

- Dont's:
  - Do not be complacent. TDD's are boring but crucial for an optimal developement process and an extremely important skill to possess in the industry.
  - Don’t start without a structure. What is meant by this is to start by taking short notes, and once all those are good you can start expanding on it in greater detail.
  - Don’t forget your punctuation and grammar. I know, I know, boring. This is crucial to avoid any confusion though, so before any TDD is comitted, run it through a spellchecker
